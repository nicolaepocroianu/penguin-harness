/**
 * Search filtering and grouping-by-provider for the models page (pure functions, easy to
 * unit test): grouping uses the entry's **provider field** directly ((provider, model_id) is
 * the entry's unique key, with no `<provider>/<id>` concatenation anywhere in the pipeline).
 * A provider not in the catalog list is a **user-defined group**: each
 * forms its own group, keeping its original value, with OpenAI protocol semantics (env
 * fallback OPENAI_*), sorted by name and appended after custom. Matches model_id /
 * display name / provider / vendor name case-insensitively; built-in group order follows
 * the MODEL_PROVIDERS definition. Empty groups aren't returned, except the custom group,
 * which is always shown when there's no search query (rendered even when empty, to host
 * the generic "add model" entry point).
 *
 * That automatic sequence is the DEFAULT, not the last word: every entry point takes an
 * optional `groupOrder` — the user's dragged arrangement, stored per Project by
 * model-group-order.ts — and applies it to the assembled group list. An empty order is
 * the identity, so a profile that has never dragged a group sees exactly the catalog
 * order. Storage stays out of this module: the caller loads the array and passes it in.
