/**
 * "Reasoning & Tools" group: collapses a run of consecutive thinking +
 * tool-call items into one aggregated group.
 * Expand policy, two layers deep: the group opens while it is running and closes itself once
 * it is done, and the thinking/tool rows inside it are appended one at a time and stay closed
 * — the reader is shown that a step happened and how long it took, not its contents, until
 * they ask. A manual toggle by the user is respected afterward. A pending approval **forces it
 * open** — otherwise the approval buttons would be unreachable.
 *
 * Hierarchy: the group header is **a distinct title bar** (solid light-gray background + small
 * uppercase status text), and the thinking/tool-call rows inside the group sit on the white
 * area below it — the two are deliberately different layers, otherwise "Running"/"Done" would
 * blend visually with the step rows and the parent-child relationship would be unreadable.
 *
 * Status semantics: the group only counts as "Done" once the model stops calling tools. As long
 * as this is still the last segment and the Task is running, the model could add another step
 * at any moment (there can be a brief gap with no active item between two steps), so it always
 * shows "Running"; it flips to "Done" only once a later message (e.g. body text) pushes the
 * group away from the end, or the Task has actually finished.

          two stacked sticky levels: the currently scrolled thinking/tool row pins right

          900/60 read identically over the solid-900 card, but stuck over scrolling rows it
          would let them bleed through); z above the row level (z-[4]), below the stream's
          own overlays (back-to-bottom uses z-10). -top-4, not top-0: sticky offsets resolve
          against the scrollport INSIDE the scroll container's padding, so top-0 pins a py-4
          strip lower than the visible top and content scrolls through that gap; -top-4 is
          the same rem unit as the container's py-4, cancelling exactly at every font scale
          (the rows' top-4 = this offset plus the header's 2rem height, same reasoning). */}
