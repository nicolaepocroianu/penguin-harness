/**
 * Plugin library page: the built-in plugin library (loaded by core from the @penguinharness/* packages), shown sectioned by category.
 * A plugin ships skills and/or a hook package (scripts the harness runs at the loop's hook
 * points, e.g. after every Task), and is installed on an Agent as a whole. Groups are
 * borderless — the group header (category name + plugin count, no icon) is collapsible,
 * highlights on hover, and animates height on expand/collapse; expanded by default. Cards
 * within a group form a grid, generously sized: two per row from the sm breakpoint up, one per
 * row on narrow screens. Each card = a rounded icon tile centered against the two text rows
 * (its color comes from skillTileColor — a per-name palette hashed from the plugin name; DTO
 * icon = the plugin's raw icon.svg (beside plugin.json), rendered inline once it passes
 * sanitize, otherwise the puzzle piece) + a name (monospace) and short description on the
 * right, one line each
 * (single-line truncation, falling back to the full description when missing) + a line below
 * both with what the plugin contains ("N skills", one "<event> hook" badge per hook point)
 * and its metadata (version · usage count "used by N Agents"); group and card copy follow the
 * UI language (localizedText / localizedShortText), and groups have no description. Icon
 * buttons for actions (copy goes into aria-label and title) —
 * - Rotate "update installs" (shown only when the server lists some Agent's installed copy
 *   behind the library — `AgentSummary.pluginUpdates`; the page never compares versions
 *   itself): opens a confirm dialog (lists each Agent's old → new version and warns the
 *   overwriting reinstall drops local edits), then reinstalls the current library copy on
 *   every outdated Agent (install-again-is-update semantics), with a single success toast; the
 *   manage-installs Modal marks outdated rows with an accent "Update" button doing the same per
 *   Agent (through the same confirm);
 * - Paper plane "quick start" (plugins with at least one skill): enters /chat/new draft mode on
 *   the currently selected agent, pre-selects one of the plugin's skills the agent has
 *   installed, and pre-fills the invocation text per UI language ("use the X skill" in the
 *   active dictionary, overwriting any existing draft body); disabled unless that agent has
 *   one of the plugin's skills installed — quick start opens the draft there, so it can't
 *   pre-select a skill the current agent lacks;
 * - Download "manage installs": a Modal listing every Agent in the current Project —
 *   not-installed shows "Install", installed shows "Installed" (hover switches to
 *   "Uninstall", click to uninstall); any member can operate it; optimistic update, a
 *   top-level toast on success for install/uninstall, rollback plus a toast on failure.
 *   Installed means the whole plugin is: every one of its skills is in the Agent's installed
 *   skills and, when it ships a hook package, that package is in the Agent's installed hooks —
 *   which is why the page fetches both lists per Agent. Uninstall takes the plugin apart the
 *   same way: one DELETE per skill and one for the hook package.
