/**
 * Scroll dismissal for the shared portal panel (src/components/ui/use-portal-panel.ts),
 * which OptionMenu, Select, InfoPopover and the composer toolbar's context ring all open through.
 *
 * The panel listens for scroll in the capture phase because scroll does not bubble, and the
 * price of capture on `window` is that it hears every scrolling element in the document. The
 * rule that closes a panel whose position has gone stale must therefore ask whether the
 * scrolled container holds this panel's trigger — otherwise a chat pane auto-following a
 * streaming reply closes a panel opened in the composer toolbar, over content that never
 * moved.
 *
 * `scrollMovesAnchor` itself is exercised in context-menu.test.ts; what cannot be reached
 * from a node-only suite (`environment: "node"`, no jsdom) is the wiring, and the wiring is
 * where this silently breaks: the rule is answered with the trigger element, so a consumer
 * that never attaches `triggerRef` hands it a null owner and quietly gets the old
 * close-on-any-scroll behavior back for its own panel. So the scan below discovers the
 * hook's consumers rather than listing them, and a fifth one is covered on the day it is
 * written.
