/**
 * The WAF authoring skills, ported from Loom's vendored templates.
 *
 * A generation stage reaches these two ways: as a one-line entry in an agent's system
 * prompt with an instruction to read the file, and — for a skill carrying scripts — by the
 * server pulling a file out by path and staging it into a run workspace. Both depend on the
 * plugin loading with the names the stages ask for, which is what this pins.
