/**
 * Provider key-minting flows (the `oauth` descriptor in core's model catalog).
 *
 * A provider that publishes such a flow lets the user authorize in a browser and get a
 * **freshly minted API key** back, instead of copying one out of a console. The upstream
 * protocol is PKCE: the harness picks a random verifier, sends only its SHA-256 challenge
 * to the authorization page, and later presents the verifier to redeem the one-time code
 * the page hands back.
 *
 * Everything secret stays on this side of the wire. The verifier is generated here, kept
 * only in this process's memory, and never sent to the browser; the minted key goes
 * straight into the Project's model config and is never echoed to a caller, a URL, or a
 * log line. What the Web App holds is an opaque flow id and a status.
 *
 * That flow id is also a capability, and the flow store treats it as one: 32 random bytes
 * bound here to a user, a Project, a provider and a verifier, valid for ten minutes and
 * spendable once. The loopback redirect receiver leans on exactly that, because the browser
 * the provider redirects cannot be assumed to hold a session — see the route module. What
 * that receiver may do with the id is only `deposit`: the exchange itself runs on the
 * owner's own poll, so no key is ever written for a Project without its owner asking.
 *
 * Flows are in-memory and per-App: a restart or a platform push drops the pending ones,
 * which costs the user a re-authorization and nothing else (the upstream code expires in
 * minutes anyway, and no key exists until the exchange runs).
