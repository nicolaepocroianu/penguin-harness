/**
 * Session index service.
 *
 * Lists are served from the DB index alone — no Trace directory scanning in steady state
 * (#139), and no client-side filtering: every row is listed whichever client created it.
 * Sessions that exist only as Trace files (left behind by a pre-server CLI) are adopted
 * into the index once per boot by the startup sweep (`adoptUnmanagedTraceSessions`):
 * the trace index's registration-time facts supply (provider, model_id) / workspace,
 * and the row is stamped `client: "cli"` (approval_mode defaults, createdAt taken from
 * the timestamp embedded in session_id).
 * Create: via core's `agent.createSession` (the model reference is always a complete
 * (provider, modelId) pair — both or neither; omitting both falls back to the
 * Project's default reference, 400 if there is none); the new Session is
 * added to session-manager's active table (state idle).

   * lazy discovery walk still runs for a list call that contains rows this process has
   * not classified yet (no in-process source entry): it supplies the Trace locations for

   * classified, list calls touch only the DB.
   *
   * Optional `paging` returns just that slice (the sidebar pages with limit+1 to detect
   * "has more"); slicing happens before toInfo, so per-request source derivation (lazy
   * Trace-head reads) stays bounded by the page size.
   *
   * `category` filters to one sidebar bucket **before** paging, so offset/limit page
   * within the category. Filtering needs each walked row's category (a possible
   * Trace-head read per row, cached in the sources registry); without `withCounts`
   * the walk stops as soon as the requested page is complete. `withCounts` classifies
   * every row and returns per-category totals over the whole list — plus the same
   * totals broken down by Workspace path, and each path's newest Session's `createdAt` —
   * so the sidebar can label the collapsed folders, list every Workspace that holds
   * Sessions (not only the ones its loaded pages happen to touch) and place the groups
   * by recency, all without loading them.
   *
   * `workspaceGroup` filters the same way, to one Workspace group (see workspace-group.ts),
   * so a sidebar grouped by Workspace pages each group down its OWN stream instead of
   * sharing one per-Agent cursor — without it, one group's "load more" consumes the page
   * its siblings were about to read, and their rows move on screen untouched. The two
   * filters compose; the returned counts stay whole-Agent either way.
   *
   * `excludeOrg` drops the rows an organization owns (its desk and ticket sessions, and the
   * sub-sessions they spawned) from the stream BEFORE anything else looks at it — the page,
   * `counts`, `workspaceCounts`, `workspaceLatest` and the limit+1 "has more" all describe the
   * same own-rows stream. It is what development mode's list asks for: that list draws the
   * user's own conversations, and a total or a stamp that still counted a desk or a ticket
   * session would make its Workspace appear as a group the list can never fill. Without the
   * flag every row is served, whichever client created it.
