/**
 * Turning what Loom authored into what Penguin stores.
 *
 * #43 reads a Loom activity and reports what is there. This decides what Penguin would
 * make of it — and, as importantly, what it would have to drop.
 *
 * The dropping is the part that matters. An import that silently loses a ref's display
 * name, or quietly renames a language group it does not recognise, produces an activity
 * that looks imported and is not the one that was authored. Everything this cannot carry
 * is named, so the round-trip trial in this phase compares like with like rather than
 * discovering the gaps by eye.
