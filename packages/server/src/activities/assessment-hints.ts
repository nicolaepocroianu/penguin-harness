 * Whether a generated assessment actually covers the questions the scenes implied.

 * second pass can quietly drop one, and an assessment missing a question nobody notices is
 * an activity that never asks it.
 *
 * So the enumerated questions are kept as hints and the written assessment is checked
 * against them. Ported from `assessment_item_hints.py`, including the two details that
