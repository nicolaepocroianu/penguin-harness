/**
 * The nine generation stages ported from Loom, declared as data.
 *
 * Loom's own order lives in a string array in an Angular component and is passed in by the
 * caller; this list is the server's. The dependencies are what each stage actually reads,
 * taken from Loom's stage implementations rather than from its ordering, because the two
 * are separate statements and `misorderedStages` exists to catch them disagreeing.
 *
 * `sharedModule` marks the three stages Loom gates to the canonical ref: they write the
 * module code every ref of a product shares.
