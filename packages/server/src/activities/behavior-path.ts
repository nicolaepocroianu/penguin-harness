/**
 * Which behaviour path an activity is on, and which skills implementing it needs.

 * This looked like it needed a product decision. Measuring the real corpus said 299
 * modules are built on `src/sequence.js` and 4 on the state machine, which reads as a
 * choice between serving new work and serving everything already authored.
 *
 * It is not a choice. Loom decides per activity — `uses_legacy_sequence()` looks at what
 * the module on disk actually contains — and picks a different skill set accordingly. So
 * this is a port, not a decision, and both skill sets were restored in the authoring
 * plugin precisely because the corpus needs them.
 *
 * Ported from `implement_behavior.py`: the two shared skill lists, the behaviour skill
 * that replaces the second entry, and the de-duplication that keeps the order stable.
