/**
 * The files an acceptance test run is given, and what its agent is asked to do.
 *
 * A test run's workspace holds, beside the activity's own inputs:
 *   acceptance-input.json   what to test and where: the signed play link, the viewport, the
 *                           criteria, the test browser's executable and the scene ids
 *   activity-harness.mjs    Penguin's harness API over `playwright-core`, the only thing the
 *                           agent's tests may use to drive the player
 *   run-acceptance.mjs      starts the test browser, runs the agent's `acceptance.test.mjs`
 *                           criterion by criterion, and writes `acceptance-results.json`
 *   package.json            pins `playwright-core` to the version this server drives
 *
 * The harness talks to the player through the inspection bridge a WAF module exposes
 * (`window.Activity.Inspection`: its current state, the states and media it went through, and
 * its tap targets), and taps, holds and drags like a learner would. Neither script prints the
 * environment or any request's headers.
 *
 * Raise `HARNESS_VERSION` whenever the harness API changes, so tests written against an older
 * one are written again rather than reused.
