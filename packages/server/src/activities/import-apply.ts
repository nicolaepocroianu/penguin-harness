/**
 * Carrying out an import.
 *
 * #63 decides what Penguin would make of a Loom activity. This performs it: the product,
 * its refs, and each ref's draft actually come into existence.
 *
 * Two rules shape the whole thing, and both come from how Penguin already behaves rather
 * than from anything invented here.
 *
 * The canonical ref goes first. Penguin makes the product's FIRST ref its canonical one,
 * and the canonical ref is the only one allowed to change the shared module — three
 * generation stages are gated on it. Importing refs in numeric order would hand module
 * ownership to whichever ref happened to sort lowest, which for three real products is not
 * the ref Loom named. The first ref also carries the module folder; later refs join what
 * exists.
 *
 * A ref that is already there is skipped rather than refused. An import that cannot be run
 * twice is an import nobody dares run once, and a half-finished import — a network drop, a
 * bad spec in ref seven — has to be resumable.
