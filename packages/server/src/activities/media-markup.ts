/**
 * The media markup a scene description carries, and the scene set a media pass may not
 * change.
 *
 * A scene's description is prose with media elements embedded in it — `<audio>`, `<video>`,
 * `<image>`, `<animation>` — which is how an author says where a track plays or a picture
 * appears. When `generate_activity_spec` produces one, the markup has to be well formed, or
 * the module built from it wires media to nothing.
 *
 * Both rules are Loom's, read out of `media_contract.py` and `generate_media_spec.py`. The
 * reporting is the part worth having: every issue with a line and column, sorted, so an
 * author or a repair pass can see all of them at once.
