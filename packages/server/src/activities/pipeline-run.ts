/**
 * "Run all stages": one click that takes an activity
 * from its script to an assembled module, or one stage re-run on its own.
 *
 * It is a sequencer over the runs that exist, not a second way of running anything. Each
 * step starts the same run an author could start by hand, through `ActivityGeneration`,
 * waits for it the way the history panel does, and accepts what it produced through the
 * same accept the author would press. Every run it starts is an ordinary run in the
 * activity's history, with its own Session.
 *
 * Steps, in the order each needs the one before:
 *   spec    generate the specification from the script (applied when it completes)
 *   media   plan media from the specification (kept when already current)
 *   translations  translate and accept every narration another language lacks, or whose
 *           default-language line changed since it was translated
 *   speech  generate and accept every unbound narration with a usable script
 *   words   a decodable book only: record and accept every word pronunciation with sounds
 *           and no recording, said slowly sound by sound and then normally (pronunciation.ts)
 *   sounds  generate and accept every music and sound effect with a prompt and no file,
 *           with the chosen sound provider (ElevenLabs unless the sequence names another)
 *   images  generate and accept every unbound image with a description
 *   assessment  write and accept the assessment, when the specification uses one and this
 *           is the canonical ref that owns it
 *   module  assemble the WAF module (scaffold, configuration and behavior in one run)
 *   test    run the acceptance tests against the assembled module, when the specification
 *           has acceptance criteria and the test browser is installed
 *
 * A sequence belongs to the server that runs it: its live state is in memory, and a copy is
 * written to `activity_pipelines` as it progresses, so the Stages panel keeps every sequence
 * as history across restarts (one cut short by a restart reads as stopped). Its runs outlive
 * it in the generation history either way. A step that fails stops the sequence; nothing is
 * rolled back, and nothing after it runs.
