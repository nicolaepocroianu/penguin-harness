/**
 * Making sure every media file a QA deploy's data names is in the media repository.
 *
 * Authored media (accepted takes and uploads) is written straight into the media clone, so a
 * file the data names is either in its working tree, new or changed since the repository last
 * had it (to be published), or already committed. A file outside the partial clone's folders
 * is looked for in git's trees, which a partial clone has without downloading any file. A
 * file found nowhere is missing, and the stage fails naming it.
 *
 * git goes through the stage's runner, so a test answers it with a fake; files are read and
 * written only inside the draft roots and the media clone.
