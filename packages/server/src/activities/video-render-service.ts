/**
 * Record video (experimental, behind `activityVideoExperiment`): a kept scene composition is
 * rendered frame by frame in the test browser and encoded to an MP4 (see video-render.ts),
 * which the author may then bind to the video or animation asset it was composed for.
 *
 * A deterministic run, like a quality check: no Session and no agent, recorded in the
 * activity's run history as kind `video` under the one-run-per-activity rule. The browser
 * opens the composition on this server's loopback address through a signed composition link
 * (see composition-service.ts), the way a quality check opens the player. The recording is
 * checked (an MP4, 100 MB at most) and kept in the media repository as the run's candidate;
 * nothing is bound until the author accepts it (`ActivityGeneration.acceptVideo`).
 *
 * The browser launcher and the encoder are ports, so a test drives fakes and never starts a
 * browser or FFmpeg.
