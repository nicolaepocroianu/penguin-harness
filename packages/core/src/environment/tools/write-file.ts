/**
 * write_file — whole-file writing tool, a builtin tool implementation (BuiltinTool).
 *
 * Writes `content` to a file, creating it (including missing parent directories) or
 * overwriting it entirely; an empty string is a valid content (creates an empty file).
 * The output distinguishes "Created" from "Overwrote" and reports the size written, so
 * the model notices when it clobbered an existing file; an overwrite additionally shows a
 * git-style unified diff against the previous content when the change is small, and a
 * one-line `+X/−Y lines` summary otherwise (created files carry no diff — the model just
 * supplied the content). The write is atomic (temp file + rename, preserving an
 * overwritten file's permission bits), so a crash mid-write cannot leave the target
 * half-written; a symlinked path is followed to the file it names, so the link survives
 * and the content lands where it points. Relative paths resolve against the Workspace;
 * absolute paths are allowed (tools run with the user's full permissions, same as the
 * shell tool). The write is serialized against edit_file and other write_file calls on the
 * same file in this process (see internal/file-lock.ts), so a concurrent edit of that file
 * applies either to the content this call replaced or to the content it wrote — never
 * computed from the one and written over the other.
 * For surgical changes to an existing file, edit_file is the better tool — this one
 * replaces the whole content.
 *
 * Division of responsibility with Environment (see environment.ts): non-streaming — yields
 * one final text delta; failures (path is a directory, permission errors) are explanatory
 * text finalized as `failed`; anything unexpected that still throws is caught by
 * Environment and likewise finalized as failed. If interrupted, only reports `aborted` —
 * the interruption note is appended by Environment.
 * Docs: /docs/tools § "File tools".
