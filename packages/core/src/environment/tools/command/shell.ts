/**
 * Shell selection for command sessions.
 *
 * Commands run via `bash -lc <cmd>` wherever a bash exists. Neither platform guarantees one
 * — Windows has none by default, and a POSIX box can be launched with a PATH that has none —
 * so the resolver picks the best available shell once per process:
 *
 * 1. `PENGUIN_SHELL` (explicit executable name or path) always wins, on every platform;
 *    the argument shape is inferred from its basename (see below).
 * 2. Otherwise, non-Windows uses `bash -lc` — but only after confirming a `bash` exists.
 *    A GUI-launched app inherits the desktop session's PATH, not a login shell's, and a
 *    trimmed session PATH (or a distribution that simply does not install bash) leaves
 *    `spawn("bash")` dying with ENOENT before the command runs at all. So: `bash` on
 *    PATH, then the usual absolute locations, then `$SHELL` when it is some other POSIX
 *    shell, then `sh`. The probe is a PATH walk, not a subprocess.
 * 3. On Windows, probe PATH for `bash` (a full Git for Windows install — best compatibility
 *    with the skill/prompt ecosystem, which is written for a POSIX shell). A `bash` that
 *    resolves into the Windows system directory is ignored: that is the WSL launcher, which
 *    runs commands inside a Linux distro with a different filesystem view (and fails outright
 *    when no distro is configured).
 *    Git for Windows' installer by default puts only its `cmd` folder on PATH, which holds
 *    `git` but not `bash`, so the same install is also found through `git`: the `bash.exe`
 *    in the `bin` folder of the install that `git` resolves into.
 * 4. Then `PENGUIN_BUNDLED_SHELL` — the MinGit bash the Windows package ships (see the
 *    release workflow), advertised by the launcher shims as an absolute path. It comes
 *    *after* the PATH probe on purpose: a user's own Git for Windows carries the full MSYS
 *    userland (curl, tar, less, perl …), while MinGit carries ~60 core tools, so when both
 *    exist theirs is the better shell. This step is what makes the shell deterministic —
 *    without it, the same Agent and the same Skill behave differently on two Windows
 *    machines depending on what happens to be installed.
 * 5. Only then `pwsh` (PowerShell 7+), and finally `powershell` (Windows PowerShell 5.1,
 *    always present). These remain reachable for npm installs, which ship no bundle.
 *
 * Argument shapes by basename (also applied to `PENGUIN_SHELL` values):
 * - `pwsh` / `powershell` -> `-NoLogo -NoProfile -Command <cmd>`
 * - `cmd`                 -> `/d /s /c <cmd>`
 * - anything else         -> `-lc <cmd>` (bash/zsh/sh-style login shell)
 *
 * `-lc` matters for the bundled shell: as a login shell it sources MinGit's `etc/profile`,
 * which defaults to `MSYS2_PATH_TYPE=inherit` and yields
 * `/mingw64/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:<inherited Windows PATH>` — the bundled coreutils
 * and git first, the inherited Windows PATH still behind them, so System32's `curl.exe` and
 * `tar.exe` (which MinGit does not carry) keep resolving. Nothing has to plumb PATH by hand.
 *
 * The resolved shell's name is surfaced to the model via the session environment (the
 * `Shell:` line in the system prompt), so it knows which syntax the exec tool speaks.
