/**
 * Build outputs that are not JavaScript, written next to the tsup bundles by `pnpm build`.
 *
 * What goes into an installer is decided declaratively in electron-builder.yml; this script
 * only produces this package's own artifacts, in the one layout that serves both a source run
 * and a packaged app:
 *
 * - `dist/node_modules/node-pty` — the one dependency the bundler cannot absorb, because the
 *   server loads it as a native module through a runtime `require` and node-pty's own loader
 *   then resolves its binary package-relative. See src/pty-payload.ts. (The plugin library is
 *   not staged here: the @penguinharness/* packages are this package's `dependencies`, which
 *   electron-builder collects into the packed app's node_modules and pnpm links for a source
 *   run, and core's bundled loader resolves them by name from the bundle's own location. The
 *   server's web-dist lookup is likewise satisfied by electron-builder's file mapping when
 *   packaging; a source run falls back to packages/web/dist on its own.)
 * - `dist/node_modules/ffmpeg-static` — the FFmpeg binary activity videos are encoded with,
 *   staged as its package so the bundled server resolves it by name (see below).
 * - `dist/icon.png`, `dist/tray/*.png` — the runtime window and tray icons, read
 *   app-path-relative (see src/app-icon.ts). build/ is electron-builder's buildResources
 *   directory and does not ship inside the app.
 * - `bin/penguin`, `bin/penguin.cmd` — the CLI launchers, whose script text lives in
 *   src/launcher.ts so it is unit-tested with the rest of the shell.
 * - `dist/install.sh`, `dist/install.ps1` — the release installers, which the Machines page
 *   scp's to an SSH host and runs there (packages/server/src/machines/install-server.ts
 *   resolves them beside its own module). The server package ships them in its own dist/,
 *   but this app re-bundles the server into a single dist/server.js and a bundle carries no
 *   sibling files, so they are copied in again here. Only the ~4 KB scripts travel: the far
 *   side downloads the release itself.
 *
 * Run from anywhere (after tsup); all paths derive from this file's location.
