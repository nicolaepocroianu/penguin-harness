# Built-in plugins

The PenguinHarness plugin library. Each plugin is its own npm package — `@penguinharness/<name>`, a directory under `plugins/` — with a `plugin.json` manifest (and an `icon.svg` beside it: the icon of everything the plugin ships, which its installed skills and hook package inherit) plus the content it ships: **skills** (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, installed into an Agent's `agent_state/skills/`) and/or a **hook package** (`hooks/*.mjs`, installed into `agent_state/hooks/<plugin>/` with a generated `hooks.json`). The loader lives in `@prismshadow/penguin-core`, which depends on these packages and reads their directories at runtime — the files are the source of truth.

Versions are dates with a sequence number — `YYYY.MM.DD.N` — on the manifest and on every skill a plugin ships (the manifest's dated version is the plugin's own; the package's npm version follows the release). Skills follow the "index first, body on demand" design: only their metadata is injected into an Agent's system prompt; the Agent reads the full `SKILL.md` via shell when it actually needs it. Hook scripts are plain Node (builtins only): the harness runs them as subprocesses at the loop's hook points with `{ hook, session_id, trace_path }` on stdin and reads their JSON answer from stdout.

Included plugins, by category (`PLUGIN_CATEGORIES` in `packages/core/src/plugins/index.ts`; a plugin with no or an unknown category lands in an "Other" group). A plugin built around someone else's product carries a `use-` prefix — `use-firecrawl`, `use-bento-slides`, `use-claude-code` — so the package name says what it is for rather than claiming the product; the skills inside keep their own names:

| Category | Plugins |
| --- | --- |
| Office Productivity | `data-analysis`, `use-firecrawl`, `use-bento-slides`, `humanizer`, `goal`, `continual-learning` |
| Software Development | `software-development`, `use-claude-code`, `use-mini-swe-agent` |
| AI App Development | `agent-development`, `model-development`, `skill-porting`, `agent-tuning` |
| Agent Company | `agent-company` |

`use-mini-swe-agent` is opt-in (`preinstall: false`). Its `mini-swe-agent` skill ships a Python runner for bounded coding tasks with explicit provider credentials, an isolated workspace, and saved trajectory and result files. It requires `uv` and a POSIX execution environment (WSL on Windows).

`humanizer`, `use-claude-code`, `continual-learning` and `agent-company` carry `preinstall: false`, so `default_agent` does not get them at initialization — they are installed from the library on demand (`agent-company` by the organization itself, when it creates the CEO and hires employees, or by hand onto any Agent that should be able to create one). `goal` is the stop hook behind goal mode: its `start.mjs` writes the Session's `GOAL.json` and composes round 1, its `stop.mjs` reads the Trace after every Task and injects the next round or ends the goal. `continual-learning` hands a long task's condensed excerpt to a background subagent that folds the findings into the agent's skills.

`agent-tuning` powers the self-improvement loop: create the Target Agent, design a Benchmark, evaluate it, optimize it to version N+1 with a snapshot before every round.

`agent-company` is the whole toolkit of company mode, entry point included. `company-setup` is that entry point: the skill that creates an organization with the user, asking one question at a time and ending at `penguin org create`, leaving hiring and tickets to the CEO. `company-employee` is the protocol every desk and ticket session follows — including the rule that whatever touches the user's machine, spends money or reaches outside the organization is asked of the board in the all-hands channel first — and `company-ceo`, `company-hr` and `company-finance` are the playbooks of those titles. `company-research` is what a research organization's authors and reviewers add: fix the harness and the metric, run the experiment loop inside a resource envelope the board approved, keep only improvements, and put every claim through a reviewer who tries to break it. `company-mirror` is the seventh: the protocol a company of digital twins runs on instead, where every employee mirrors a real colleague and the company relays between people rather than filing tickets. Because the plugin is `preinstall: false`, `company-setup` is no longer on every Agent by default — an Agent gets it by installing `agent-company` from the library (the Agents page), and the CEO and the employees carry it already.

## Development

The plugins are data, not code — there is nothing to build here. The loader, its types and their tests live in `packages/core`:

```bash
pnpm --filter @prismshadow/penguin-core build       # includes the plugin loader
pnpm --filter @prismshadow/penguin-core test        # loader, README tables, the hook scripts against fake Traces
```
